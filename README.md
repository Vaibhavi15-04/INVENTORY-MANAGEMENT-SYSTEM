# INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This is a JSON based INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM using python.


The project is basically divide into four portion.
    1st portion is for storing the written records into a JSON file. I have taken four different categories and created 4 different Json file.
    
    2nd portion is for insertion of new products in the inventory. 
    
    3rd portion is for updating information related to already existing product in the inventory. Whch is also I have divided into 2 parts:
         1st updation of price.
         2nd updation of quantity.
      
    4th portion is for the purpose of purchasing, which is also further divided into 4 parts.
        1st part is a menu driven program what based on what they can purchase or what things are available for purchasing in 
        which you have to tell them from how many categories you want to purchase, then how many items you want to purchase 
        and then it ask for product id and quantity.
        2nd part is for billing, the programm take the necessary information of customer and bill the amount of how much 
        purchasing have been done by customer.
        3rd part take all the information of customer from above billing system and store it in a JSON file name 'PURCHASE'.
        4th part keep the track record of sales done in a JSON file named 'SALES'.
        
  ---> AS I HAVE SAID THAT THE INVENTORY IS DIVIDED INTO 4 DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO BEFORE PERFORMING ANY OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED FUUCTION IT 
  WILL ASK  YOU ABOUT IN WHICH CATEGORY YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGES.(FOR 2ND AND 3RD PORTION)
